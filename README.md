This project is another project from The Odin Project, from the Foundations part. It was made with basic HTML and CSS, after a mockup image.

The purpose of this project is to exercise some HTML concept already learned, but primarily to fix a couple of basic CSS concepts, such as adding style to a webpage(changing fonts, bg-color, text color, rounding borders etc.), the cascade, the box model and the flexbox (growing and shrinking, the aces, alignment).

I attached the mockup and the directions image(colors and fonts directions) in the images directory.
